#+title: Ematrix (personal emacs configuration)
#+author: donney
#+startup: overview

* Introduction
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an Emacs companion,
[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+begin_quote
Redditor 1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool. \\
Redditor 2: Oh, there's an Emacs mode for that.
#+end_quote

This was enough for me to install Emacs, but I soon learned there are [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs#why-emacs][far more
compelling reasons]] to keep using it.

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is both my config, and a cautionary tale (just replace
"Linux" with "Emacs" in the comic below).

[[xkcd:456]]

** Why Emacs?
Emacs is [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][not a text editor]], this is a common misnomer. It is far more apt to
describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text
manipulation environment/. That's quite a mouthful.
In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related
applications. It's a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is
generic.

Good with text. How far does that go? A lot further than one initially thinks:
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Task planning]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][File management]]
+ [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Terminal emulation]]
+ [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Email client]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Remote server tool]]
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Git frontend]]
+ Web [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][client]]/[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][server]]
+ and more...

Ideally, one may use Emacs as /the/ interface to perform =input → transform →
output= cycles, i.e. form a bridge between the human mind and information
manipulation.

*** The enveloping editor
Emacs allows one to do more in one place than any other application. Why is this
good?
+ Enables one to complete tasks with a consistent, standard set of keybindings,
  GUI and editing methods --- learn once, use everywhere
+ Reduced context-switching
+ Compressing the stages of a project --- a more centralised workflow can progress
  with greater ease
+ Integration between tasks previously relegated to different applications, but
  with a common subject --- e.g. linking to an email in a to-do list

Emacs can be thought of as a platform within which various elements of your
workflow may settle, with the potential for rich integrations between them --- a
/life/ IDE if you will.

Today, many aspects of daily computer usage are split between different
applications which act like islands, but this often doesn't mirror how we
/actually use/ our computers. Emacs, if one goes down the rabbit hole, can give
users the power to bridge this gap.

*** Some notably unique features
+ Recursive editing
+ Completely introspectable, with pervasive docstrings
+ Mutable environment, which can be incrementally modified
+ Functionality without applications
+ Client-server separation allows for a daemon, giving near-instant perceived
  startup time.

*** Issues
+ Emacs has irritating quirks
+ Some aspects are showing their age (naming conventions, APIs)
+ Emacs is ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Threads.html][mostly]]) single-threaded, meaning that when something holds that
  thread up the whole application freezes
+ A few other nuisances

*** Teach a man to fish...
#+begin_quote
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed
him for a lifetime. --- Anne Isabella
#+end_quote

Most popular editors have a simple and pretty [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings][settings interface]], filled with
check-boxes, selects, and the occasional text-box. This makes it easy for the
user to pick between common desirable behaviours. To me this is now like /giving
a man a fish/.

What if you want one of those 'check-box' settings to be only on in certain
conditions? Some editors have workspace settings, but that requires you to
manually set the value for /every single instance/. Urgh, [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93153][what]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93628][a]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5595][pain]].

What if you could set the value of that 'check-box' setting to be the result of
an arbitrary expression evaluated for each file? This is where an editor like
Emacs comes in.
Configuration for Emacs isn't a list of settings in JSON etc. it's *an executable
program which modifies the behaviour of the editor to suit your liking*.
This is 'teaching a man to fish'.

Emacs is built in the same language you configure it in (Emacs [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][elisp]]).
It comes with a broad array of useful functions for text-editing, and Doom adds
a few handy little convenience functions.

Want to add a keybinding to delete the previous line? It's as easy as
#+name: Keybinding to delete the previous line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(map! "C-d"
      (cmd! (previous-line)
            (kill-line)
            (forward-line)))
#+end_src

How about another example, say you want to be presented with a list of currently
open /buffers/ (think files, almost) when you split the window. It's as simple as
#+name: Prompt for buffer after split
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after 'window-split (switch-to-buffer))
#+end_src

Want to test it out? You don't need to save and restart, you can just /evaluate
the expression/ within your current Emacs instance and try it immediately! This
editor is, after all, a Lisp interpreter.

Want to tweak the behaviour? Just re-evaluate your new version --- it's a
super-tight iteration loop.

** Editor comparison

[[xkcd:378]]

Over the years I have tried out (spent at least a year using as my primary
editor) the following applications
- Python IDLE
- Komodo Edit
- Brackets
- VSCode
- and now, Emacs

I have attempted to quantify aspects of my impressions of them below.

#+plot: transpose:yes type:radar min:0 max:4 ticks:4 file:"misc/editor-comparison.svg"

** Notes for the unwary adventurer
If you like the look of this, that's marvellous, and I'm really happy that I've
made something which you may find interesting, however:
#+begin_warning
This config is /insidious/. Copying the whole thing blindly can easily lead to
undesired effects. I recommend copying chunks instead.
#+end_warning

If you are so bold as to wish to steal bits of my config (or if I upgrade and
wonder why things aren't working), here's a list of sections which rely on
external setup (i.e. outside of this config).

+ dictionary :: I've downloaded a custom [[http://app.aspell.com/create][SCOWL]] dictionary, which I use in [[*Ispell][ispell]].
  If this causes issues, just delete the src_elisp{(setq ispell-dictionary ...)}
  bit.

Oh, did I mention that I started this config when I didn't know any =elisp=, and
this whole thing is a hack job? If you can suggest any improvements, please do
so, no matter how much criticism you include I'll appreciate it :)

[[xkcd:1513]]

*** Extra Requirements
The lovely ~doom doctor~ is good at diagnosing most missing things, but here are a
few extras.
+ A [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][LaTeX Compiler]] is required for the mathematics rendering performed in [[#org][Org]],
  and by [[*CalcTeX][CalcTeX]].
+ I use the [[https://overpassfont.org/][Overpass]] font as a go-to sans serif.
  It's used as my ~doom-variable-pitch-font~ and in the graph generated
  by [[*Roam][Roam]].
  I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
  desirable, namely:
  - A clean, and legible style. Highway-style fonts tend to be designed to be
    clear at a glance, and work well with a thicker weight, and this is inspired
    by /Highway Gothic/.
  - It's slightly quirky. Look at the diagonal cut on stems for example.
    Helvetica is a masterful design, but I like a bit more pizzazz now and then.
+ A few LSP servers. Take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] to see which modules have the ~+lsp~ flag.
** Current Issues
*** Magit push in daemon
Quite often trying to push to a remote in the Emacs daemon produces as error like this:
#+begin_src fundamental
128 git … push -v origin refs/heads/master\:refs/heads/master
Pushing to git@github.com:tecosaur/emacs-config.git

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
#+end_src
*** Unread emails doesn't work across Emacs instances
It would be nice if it did, so that I could have the Emacs-daemon hold the
active mu4e session, but still get that information. In this case I'd want to
change the action to open the Emacs daemon, but it should be possible.

This would probably involve hooking into the daemon's modeline update function
to write to a temporary file, and having a file watcher started in other Emacs
instances, in a similar manner to [[*Rebuild mail index while using mu4e][Rebuild mail index while using mu4e]].

After loading Emacs, the `emacs-startup-hook' gets executed, we

Lastly we require the `ematrix-loaded' synchronization module,
which runs the `ematrix-after-startup-hook' hooks and provide
`ematrix-loaded' so the packages loaded with `:after
ematrix-loaded' can be loaded.

The `ematrix-loaded' will require `ematrix-lazy', which
incrementally run the hooks in `ematrix-lazy-hook' after

the packages loaded with `:after ematrix-lazy' can be loaded."

;;; Keybinding macros
;;; =================

;; v7.0.0 to a more classic (non Evil-based) keybindings. These macros are left
;; for now to avoid breaking users configurations, they might be deleted in a
;; future release.
;; PERF+HACK: At some point, Ematrix startup become too slow, specially when
;; initializing `general' and `evil'. After trying several configurations, I
;; figured out that deferring `general' solves the issue. However, deferring
;; `general' means that we cannot define the keybindings when loading other
;; packages, i.e. before `general' gets loaded and the Ematrix definers (i.e.
;; `+ematrix--internal-map!', `+ematrix--internal-map-local!', ...) are made
;; available. We overcome this by defining these macros to define the
;; keybindings by wrapping the actual definition in a `with-eval-after-load'
;; block to be evaluated only after `general' gets loaded and configured and the

  "Ematrix fonts used by `+setup-fonts'.

The function checks and enables the first available font from these defined in
this plist. This variable can be customized to set font specs for specific Emacs
faces or to enable some language-specific fonts. The plist keywords are either
face names or script names expressed as keywords (with the \":\" prefix).

For example to set `default' face, use `:default', to set the `mode-line' face,
use `:mode-line', and so on. The parameters for each font in these cases (ie.
for face names) are used in the `custom-theme-set-faces' function, so you can
pass any specs (key value pairs) supported by `custom-theme-set-faces' (like
`:weight', `:slant', `:foreground', ...). A list of supported keywords are
available in the variable `+face-attributes'.

You can also setup some language-specific fonts. All scripts supported by Emacs
can be found in `+known-scripts'. The keyword in this plist will be the script
name expressed as a keyword, for example, for `latin' use `:latin', for `arabic'
use `:arabic', for `emoji' use `:emoji', and so on. In this case, the parameters
are used with `set-fontset-font', so you can send any key value pair supported
by `set-fontset-font'. A list of supported keywords in this case is available in
`+font-spec-keywords'.

The value of the extra `:prepend' keyword is passed the last argument to
`set-fontset-font'. The value of the extra `:scale' keyword can be used to set a
scaling factor for the font in Emacs' `face-font-rescale-alist'. See the
`+setup-fonts' implementation for more details."

;;; Commentary:
;;; 这个 compat 包是 Emacs 的 向前兼容性库，主要作用是为旧版本的 Emacs 提供新版本才有的函数和宏定义。
;;; 核心功能
;;; 提供新功能兼容：让基于旧版 Emacs（最低支持 24.4）开发的包也能使用新版 Emacs 引入的函数和宏
;;; 按需加载：只有当当前 Emacs 版本确实需要时才会安装这些定义
;;; 无性能影响：如果在较新的 Emacs 版本上编译，所有兼容定义都会在编译时被禁用，不会带来任何性能损耗

;; me-use-package.el --- Extend use-package to allow straight-x package pinning -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
<<logo>>
;;; Commentary:

;; ## Use-package & straight.el extensions

;; - `:pin-ref' - allow pinning package version (installed via `straight') to a
;;   specific commit/revision from `use-package' using the `:pin-ref' keyword.
;;   github.com/radian-software/straight.el#how-do-i-pin-package-versions-or-use-only-tagged-releases
;;
;; - `:trigger-commands' - allow loading the package before executing a specific
;;   external command/function using the `:trigger-commands' keyword.
;;
;; - Better handling of conditionally enabled packages, when a package is
;;   disabled, don't install it but register it in the packages list via
;;   `straight-register-package' so it gets tracked and pinned in the version
;;   lock.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
